# Self-Organizing Recurrent Neural Networks

SORN is a class of neuro-inspired artificial network build based on plasticity mechanisms in biological brain and mimic neocortical circuits ability of learning and adaptation. SORN consists of pool of excitatory neurons and small population of inhibitory neurons which are controlled by 5 plasticity mechanisms found in neocortex, namely Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), Intrinsic Plasticity (IP), Synaptic Scaling (SS),Synaptic Normalization(SN) and inhibitory Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (iSTDP). Using mathematical tools, SORN network simplifies the underlying structural and functional connectivity mechanisms responsible for learning and memory in the brain

'sorn' is a Python package designed for Self Organizing Recurrent Neural Networks. It provides a research environment for computational neuroscientists to study the self-organization, adaption, learning,memory and behavior of brain circuits by reverse engineering neural plasticity mechanisms. Further to extend the potential applications of `sorn`, a demostrative example of a neuro-robotics experiment using OpenAI gym is also [documented](https://self-organizing-recurrent-neural-networks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

## Installation

```python
pip install sorn
```

The library is still in alpha stage, so you may also want to install the latest version from the development branch

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/Saran-nns/sorn
```

## Dependencies
SORN supports `Python 3.7+` ONLY. For older Python versions please use the official Python client.
To install all optional dependencies,

```python
  pip install 'sorn[all]'
```
## Usage
### Plasticity Phase

```python
import sorn
from sorn import Simulator
import numpy as np

# Sample input
num_features = 10
time_steps = 200
inputs = np.random.rand(num_features,time_steps)

# Simulate the network with default hyperparameters under gaussian white noise
state_dict, sim_dict = Simulator.simulate_sorn(inputs = inputs, phase='plasticity',
                                                matrices=None, noise = True,
                                                timesteps=time_steps,
                                                callbacks = ["ExcitatoryActivation", 
                                                             "WEE", 
                                                             "EEConnectionCounts"])

```
```

```
### Training Phase
```python
from sorn import Trainer
# NOTE: During training phase, input to `sorn` should have second (time) dimension set to 1. ie., input shape should be (input_features,1).

inputs = np.random.rand(num_features,1)

# SORN network is frozen during training phase
state_dict, sim_dict = Trainer.train_sorn(inputs = inputs, phase='training',
                                            matrices=state_dict, noise= False,
                                            timesteps=1,
                                            ne = 100, nu=num_features,
                                            lambda_ee = 10, eta_stdp=0.001, 
                                            callbacks = ["InhibitoryActivation", 
                                                          "WEI", 
                                                          "EIConnectionCounts"] )
